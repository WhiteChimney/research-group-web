noabstract={Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a promising solution for sharing information-theoretic secure keys between remote peers with physics-based protocols. According to the law of quantum physics, the photons carrying signals cannot be amplified or relayed via classical optical techniques to maintain quantum security. As a result, the transmission loss of the channel limits its achievable distance, and this has been a huge barrier towards building large-scale quantum-secure networks. Here we present an experimental QKD system that could tolerate a channel loss beyond 140{\thinspace},dB and obtain a secure distance of 833.8{\thinspace},km, setting a new record for fibre-based QKD. Furthermore, the optimized four-phase twin-field protocol and high-quality set-up make its secure key rate more than two orders of magnitude greater than previous records over similar distances. Our results mark a breakthrough towards building reliable and efficient terrestrial quantum-secure networks over a scale of 1,000{\thinspace},km.},

noabstract = {Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD) is a revolutionary protocol since it is physically immune to all attacks on the detection side. However, the protocol still keeps the strict assumptions on the source side that specify that the four BB84 states must be perfectly prepared to ensure security. Some protocols release part of the assumptions in the encoding system to keep the practical security, but the performance would be dramatically reduced. In this work, we present a MDIQKD protocol that requires less knowledge of the encoding system to combat the troublesome modulation errors and fluctuations. We have also experimentally demonstrated the protocol. The result indicates a high performance and good security for practical applications. Its robustness and flexibility also exhibit a good value for complex scenarios such as the QKD networks.},

noabstract = {Twin-Field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) and its variants, e.g. phase-maching QKD, sending-or-not-sending QKD, and no phase post-selection TFQKD promise high key rates at long distance to beat the rate distance limit without a repeater. The security proof of these protocols are based on decoy-state method, which is usually performed by actively modulating a variable optical attenuator together with a random number generator in practical experiments, however, active-decoy schemes like this may lead to side channel and could open a security loophole. To enhance the source security of TF-QKD, in this paper, we propose passive-decoy based TF-QKD, in which we combine TF-QKD with the passive-decoy method. And we present a simulation comparing the key generation rate with that in active-decoy, the result shows our scheme performs as good as active decoy TF-QKD, and our scheme could reach satisfactory secret key rates with just a few photon detectors. This shows our work is meaningful in practice.},
