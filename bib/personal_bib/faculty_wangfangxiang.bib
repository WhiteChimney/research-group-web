abstract={Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a promising solution for sharing information-theoretic secure keys between remote peers with physics-based protocols. According to the law of quantum physics, the photons carrying signals cannot be amplified or relayed via classical optical techniques to maintain quantum security. As a result, the transmission loss of the channel limits its achievable distance, and this has been a huge barrier towards building large-scale quantum-secure networks. Here we present an experimental QKD system that could tolerate a channel loss beyond 140{\thinspace}dB and obtain a secure distance of 833.8{\thinspace}km, setting a new record for fibre-based QKD. Furthermore, the optimized four-phase twin-field protocol and high-quality set-up make its secure key rate more than two orders of magnitude greater than previous records over similar distances. Our results mark a breakthrough towards building reliable and efficient terrestrial quantum-secure networks over a scale of 1,000{\thinspace}km.},

abstract={Self-stabilizing the quantum key distribution (QKD) system is essential to evaluate eavesdroppers' information accurately. We develop and verify a polarization-insensitive time-bin decoder chip for QKD with the hybrid asymmetric Faraday-Michelson interferometer (AFMI) based on the planar lightwave circuit (PLC). Compared with existing chip-based QKD works, the scheme can intrinsically compensate for the polarization perturbation to quantum signals and thus work at arbitrary temperatures. We experimentally verify the chips in a time-bin QKD system at the clocking rate of 1.25 GHz and obtain an average secure key rate (SKR) of 1.34 Mbps over a 50 km fiber channel with an optimized analysis model. The steady variations of the quantum bit error and SKR with random polarization disturbance demonstrate that PLC-based AFMIs are available for developing self-stable QKD systems.},
