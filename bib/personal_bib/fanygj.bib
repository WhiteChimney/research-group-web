abstract = {There is no doubt that measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is a crucial protocol that is immune to all possible detector side channel attacks. In the preparation phase, a simulation model is usually employed to get a set of optimized parameters, which is utilized for getting a higher secure key rate in reality. With the implementation of high-speed QKD, the afterpulse effect which is an intrinsic characteristic of the single-photon avalanche photodiode is no longer ignorable, this will lead to a great deviation compared with the existing analytical model. Here we develop an afterpulse-compatible MDI-QKD model to get the optimized parameters. Our results indicate that by using our afterpulse-compatible model, we can get a much higher key rate than the prior afterpulse-omitted model. It is significant to take the afterpulse effect into consideration because of the improvement of the system working frequency.},

abstract={Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a promising solution for sharing information-theoretic secure keys between remote peers with physics-based protocols. According to the law of quantum physics, the photons carrying signals cannot be amplified or relayed via classical optical techniques to maintain quantum security. As a result, the transmission loss of the channel limits its achievable distance, and this has been a huge barrier towards building large-scale quantum-secure networks. Here we present an experimental QKD system that could tolerate a channel loss beyond 140{\thinspace}dB and obtain a secure distance of 833.8{\thinspace}km, setting a new record for fibre-based QKD. Furthermore, the optimized four-phase twin-field protocol and high-quality set-up make its secure key rate more than two orders of magnitude greater than previous records over similar distances. Our results mark a breakthrough towards building reliable and efficient terrestrial quantum-secure networks over a scale of 1,000{\thinspace}km.},
