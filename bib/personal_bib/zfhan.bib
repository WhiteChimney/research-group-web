abstract = {A wide area quantum key distribution (QKD) network deployed on communication infrastructures provided by China Mobile Ltd. is demonstrated. Three cities and two metropolitan area QKD networks were linked up to form the Hefei-Chaohu-Wuhu wide area QKD network with over 150 kilometers coverage area, in which Hefei metropolitan area QKD network was a typical full-mesh core network to offer all-to-all interconnections, and Wuhu metropolitan area QKD network was a representative quantum access network with point-to-multipoint configuration. The whole wide area QKD network ran for more than 5000 hours, from 21 December 2011 to 19 July 2012, and part of the network stopped until last December. To adapt to the complex and volatile field environment, the Faraday-Michelson QKD system with several stability measures was adopted when we designed QKD devices. Through standardized design of QKD devices, resolution of symmetry problem of QKD devices, and seamless switching in dynamic QKD network, we realized the effective integration between point-to-point QKD techniques and networking schemes.},

abstract = {We report a demonstration of quantum key distribution (QKD) over a standard telecom fiber exceeding 50 dB in loss and 250 km in length. The differential phase shift QKD protocol was chosen and implemented with a 2 GHz system clock rate. By careful optimization of the 1 bit delayed Faraday--Michelson interferometer and the use of the superconducting single photon detector (SSPD), we achieved a quantum bit error rate below 2\% when the fiber length was no more than 205 km, and of 3.45\% for a 260 km fiber with 52.9 dB loss. We also improved the quantum efficiency of SSPD to obtain a high key rate for 50 km length.},

abstract = {Twin-Field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) and its variants, e.g. phase-maching QKD, sending-or-not-sending QKD, and no phase post-selection TFQKD promise high key rates at long distance to beat the rate distance limit without a repeater. The security proof of these protocols are based on decoy-state method, which is usually performed by actively modulating a variable optical attenuator together with a random number generator in practical experiments, however, active-decoy schemes like this may lead to side channel and could open a security loophole. To enhance the source security of TF-QKD, in this paper, we propose passive-decoy based TF-QKD, in which we combine TF-QKD with the passive-decoy method. And we present a simulation comparing the key generation rate with that in active-decoy, the result shows our scheme performs as good as active decoy TF-QKD, and our scheme could reach satisfactory secret key rates with just a few photon detectors. This shows our work is meaningful in practice.},

abstract={Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a promising solution for sharing information-theoretic secure keys between remote peers with physics-based protocols. According to the law of quantum physics, the photons carrying signals cannot be amplified or relayed via classical optical techniques to maintain quantum security. As a result, the transmission loss of the channel limits its achievable distance, and this has been a huge barrier towards building large-scale quantum-secure networks. Here we present an experimental QKD system that could tolerate a channel loss beyond 140{\thinspace},dB and obtain a secure distance of 833.8{\thinspace},km, setting a new record for fibre-based QKD. Furthermore, the optimized four-phase twin-field protocol and high-quality set-up make its secure key rate more than two orders of magnitude greater than previous records over similar distances. Our results mark a breakthrough towards building reliable and efficient terrestrial quantum-secure networks over a scale of 1,000{\thinspace},km.},

abstract = {Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD) is a revolutionary protocol since it is physically immune to all attacks on the detection side. However, the protocol still keeps the strict assumptions on the source side that specify that the four BB84 states must be perfectly prepared to ensure security. Some protocols release part of the assumptions in the encoding system to keep the practical security, but the performance would be dramatically reduced. In this work, we present a MDIQKD protocol that requires less knowledge of the encoding system to combat the troublesome modulation errors and fluctuations. We have also experimentally demonstrated the protocol. The result indicates a high performance and good security for practical applications. Its robustness and flexibility also exhibit a good value for complex scenarios such as the QKD networks.},
